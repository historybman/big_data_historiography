# Defining the problem

History journals explore change over time, but they also change over time themselves. They reflect social changes, changes in intellectual fashion, organizational and institional changes within the agencies that publish historical scholarship. We have our own sense of what "trends" have defined historical scholarship over the last several years, as well as those characteristics that define and distinguish one subset of the history publishing landscape from another. But what can an algorithmic approach add to our understanding of these trends, and these identities? 

The present project attempts to address this question through exploratory data analysis. Focused on data from three prominent historical journals-- the AHR, JAH, and WMQ-- this project proposes to use algorithmic classification, as well as simple word counting algorithms (dunnings log likelihood, e.g.), to test whether trends and patterns exist in the dataset, either across time or journal class.
